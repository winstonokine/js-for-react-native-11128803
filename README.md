### Overview

This repository contains solutions for a set of tasks that rely on JavaScript functions for array manipulation and user profile construction. The brief description and execution of each task are given below.

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

- **Description:**  The function "processArray" accepts an array of numbers as input and generates a new array based on certain rules. In the resulting array, every even number is squared, and every odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings

- **Description:** "formatArrayStrings" is a function that can work with two arrays: one that has strings and the other that holds integers that are processed by "processArray." The function modifies each string in the string array according to its corresponding number. If the number is even, it capitalizes the entire string; if it is odd, it converts the string to lowercase..


### Task 3: Creating User Profiles

- **Description:** Two arrays are accepted by the "createUserProfiles" function: one with the original names and another with the updated names from Task 2. Each item in the array that is returned has the original name, the updated name, and an auto-incremented ID that starts at 1.
